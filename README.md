# RecyclerView Example

This Android application demonstrates the usage of a RecyclerView to display a list of items in a vertical scrolling fashion.

## Components

### 1. `activity_main.xml`

Defines the main UI of the application with a RelativeLayout as the root layout and a RecyclerView as its only child element.

### 2. `item_view.xml`

Defines the layout for individual items in the RecyclerView. Each item consists of an ImageView for displaying an image, and two TextViews for displaying the name and email address of the item.

### 3. `MyViewHolder.java`

Represents the ViewHolder pattern for RecyclerView. It holds references to the views in each item layout and is responsible for binding data to these views.

### 4. `MyAdapter.java`

Serves as the adapter for the RecyclerView. It creates ViewHolders for each item view and binds data to them. It also determines the number of items in the list.

### 5. `Item.java`

Represents the data model for each item in the RecyclerView. It contains fields for the name, email, and image of an item.

### 6. `MainActivity.java`

Entry point of the application. In its `onCreate()` method, it initializes the RecyclerView, creates a list of items, sets a LinearLayoutManager to the RecyclerView, and sets the adapter to display the list of items.
